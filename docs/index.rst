OP2
===

`OP2 <https://github.com/OP-DSL/OP2-Common>`_ is a high-level embedded domain specific language (eDSL) for writing **unstructured mesh** algorithms with automatic parellelisation on multi-core and many-core architectures. The API is embedded in both C/C++ and Fortran.

These pages provide detailed documentation on using OP2, including an installation guide, an overview of the C++ API, a walkthrough of the development of an example application, and developer documentation.

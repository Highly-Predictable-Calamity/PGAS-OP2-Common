This directory contains example applications using the C and C++ OP2 library.

Building
======================

The recommended way of building the examples is using the regular Makefiles under
each aexample pplication directory.

To compile using the regular Makefiles provided, it is required to:

1. Make sure that the OP2 backend libraries have been built under
   ~/OP2-Common/op2/c/lib

   See ~/OP2-Common/op2/c/README for instructions on building the op2
   backend libs

2. Use op2 code generator to generate the various paralleizations

   e.g for Airfoil_HDF5  the only file(s) that have OP2 API calls are airfoil.cpp

   ~/OP2-Common/translator/c/python/op2.py airfoil.cpp

   This will generate the variousl paralleizations under seperate directories
   E.g. CUDA files under ~/OP2-Common/apps/c/airfoil/airfoil_hdf5/dp/CUDA  etc.
   (see user documentation for more details)


3. Change directory to the example application directory
   e.g. cd ~/OP2-Common/apps/c/airfoil/airfoil_hdf5/dp/

   type:

   make
